# TIDEBREAKERS · PLAYCRAFT evidence pack

Generated 2026-11-05T13:31:03.457Z from commit `15a16d9` (simulations) / `bed002d` (playtest bot). Game source unchanged by this pack.

**Where this was measured:** headless Chromium with software WebGL (SwiftShader) in a Linux container. Nothing here was observed on a real phone.

## Evidence classes

| Class | Meaning | Here |
|---|---|---|
| **runtime-observed** | The production build played through its real UI by a bot; state read from the running game | playtest bot |
| **simulation-measured** | The game’s own code (economy, salvage, fuel, hull, the frame loop) driven by a script with seeded randomness; travel, combat and human skill are modelled, not played | all of tests/sim |
| **source-only** | Read from code or data, not executed | only where a row says so |
| **real-device** | Seen on a physical iPhone | none: see "Needs a human or an iPhone" |

## Playtest bot (runtime-observed)

Production build (`dist/`), iPhone-sized viewport, seed 1105, 3 run(s). Reproducible: **yes (identical fingerprints)**. Wall time per run: 62.1s, 74.8s, 75.1s.

### Salvage yield per haul (winch 2/3, no Salvager, empty hold of the boat that can reach the site)

| Site | Region | Boat (slots) | Gold/haul mean | p10–p90 | Items/haul | Gold per respawn-minute | Perfect hauls overflowing |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| The Sunken Tower | shallows | dinghy (6) | 15.4 | 11–21 | 3.5 | 3.8 | 0% |
| The Box Yard | shallows | dinghy (6) | 24.8 | 12–71 | 4.0 | 5.0 | 0% |
| Hollow Underfloors | shallows | dinghy (6) | 25.8 | 11–61 | 4.2 | 4.3 | 0% |
| Meridian Plaza | emerald | sloop (14) | 62.8 | 28–104 | 6.0 | 9.0 | 0% |
| Broadcast Spire | emerald | sloop (14) | 87.1 | 51–135 | 6.3 | 10.9 | 0% |
| The Leaning Block | emerald | sloop (14) | 39.2 | 15–126 | 4.4 | 5.6 | 0% |
| Helios Lower Deck | emerald | sloop (14) | 28.2 | 14–42 | 3.6 | 4.7 | 0% |
| Hull of the Meridian Star | emerald | sloop (14) | 146.2 | 66–268 | 10.6 | 14.6 | 0% |
| Graveyard Boxes | emerald | sloop (14) | 53.1 | 28–94 | 6.7 | 7.6 | 0% |
| The Meridian Spire | stormwall | ironwake (22) | 280.4 | 161–408 | 6.9 | 18.7 | 0% |

Winch skill matters: the Sunken Tower pays 0/3 → 7.6g, 1/3 → 15.6g, 2/3 → 15.4g, 3/3 → 30.5g. A Salvager adds about 22.5g a haul on average.

### Sourcing actions needed to afford each upgrade

From the state a player could first buy it in (prerequisites only, 15 gold), 10 seeds each. "Actions" = salvage hauls + drifting caches + flotsam. Respawn wait is the in-game time spent waiting for a salvage site to refill. Travel time is not included.

Every seed produced the same voyage: storm cells start from fixed positions and nothing on these routes is random, so the seeds confirm determinism rather than add samples.

The Skiff was stopped by the open swell in 3/3 runs and the Trimaran by the Stormwall in 3/3, as designed. The Trimaran reached Rig Helios in 3/3.

|---|---|---|
| craft Refine Fuel then sell | ok | input_value 12, output_value 10, gain_per_craft -2, margin_pct -17 |
| craft Hull Patch Kit then sell | ok | small positive margin (a few gold); not worth farming |
| craft Alloy Plate then sell | ok | small positive margin (a few gold); not worth farming |

| craft Stitch Sailcloth then sell | ok | input_value 9, output_value 8, gain_per_craft -1, margin_pct -11 |
| craft Strip Wire then sell | ok | small positive margin (a few gold); not worth farming |
| buy fuel at driftholm | ok | cans cannot be bought back from fuel, so this is only an exploit if fuel can be turned into cans (it cannot) |
| buy fuel at hollow | ok | cans cannot be bought back from fuel, so this is only an exploit if fuel can be turned into cans (it cannot) |
| buy fuel at helios | ok | cans cannot be bought back from fuel, so this is only an exploit if fuel can be turned into cans (it cannot) |
| repair 35 hull at a dock vs a patch kit | ok | a kit also works at sea |
| salvage respawn follows the device clock | **exploit** | Salvage.ready compares Date.now() with the saved haul time, so changing the phone’s clock skips respawn timers. Severity is a design call (single-player). |

## Findings (computed from the data above)

| Severity | Finding | Evidence | Class |
|---|---|---|---|
| medium | Difficulty/pacing spike: commission Scrap Trimaran | 34 sourcing actions for this step vs at most 11 for any earlier step (campaign, winch 2/3). | simulation-measured |
| medium | The Stormwall barely scratches the Ironwake | Driftholm → Meridian Spire under the real loop: Ironwake arrived in 12/12 runs, 7.9 s inside the wall on average, losing 2.2-9.7% hull (stock sail to Cutter Rig, with and without armour). The Trimaran was swamped trying in 3/3 runs. For a final barrier the crossing is short and nearly free once you own the right boat; whether that is the intent is a design call. | simulation-measured |
| medium | An extra winch hit sometimes pays nothing | The Sunken Tower: 1/3 → 15.6g vs 2/3 → 15.4g; The Box Yard: 1/3 → 23.7g vs 2/3 → 24.8g; Hollow Underfloors: 1/3 → 27.7g vs 2/3 → 25.8g. Loot rolls round to the same number for these hit counts, so landing the extra pull in the green earns no more on average. | simulation-measured |
| low | Exploit: salvage respawn follows the device clock | Salvage.ready compares Date.now() with the saved haul time, so changing the phone’s clock skips respawn timers. Severity is a design call (single-player). | simulation-measured |
| info | No progression dead ends found | Every one of the 21 upgrades and vessels became affordable and was bought through the game in every seed at every winch skill (hits_1, hits_2, hits_3). | simulation-measured |
| info | Captain's Log in the campaign stops at g_raiders | Completed: g_salvage → g_engine → g_crew → g_trimaran → g_helios → g_meridian. The raider goal needs real-time combat, which the simulation does not play; nothing after it can complete here (purchases are not gated by goals). | simulation-measured |
| info | Storm damage | A full storm (storm 1.0) costs the stock Skiff 57.6 hull/min (swamped from full in 1.0 min); the Trimaran 57.6 hull/min (1.7 min). Riveted Armour cuts it by 45.0%. Below storm 0.4 there is no damage. | simulation-measured |
| info | Crafting margins are small | Hull Patch Kit: +2g (20%); Alloy Plate: +2g (11%); Engine Parts: +3g (14%); Strip Wire: +1g (11%). Not worth farming. | simulation-measured |
| info | Sailing never needs tacking | Stock Skiff: 6.5 m/s on a beam reach, 5.8 downwind, 2.9 dead into the wind (45%). Every boat can sail straight upwind at under half speed; wind shapes speed, not routes. | simulation-measured |

No gameplay, balance or content was changed to produce any of this. Findings are for the designer to weigh.

## PLAYCRAFT evidence items

`playcraft-evidence.json` lists these for `playcraft_assess` / `playcraft_verify` (`evidence`). PLAYCRAFT records any project evidence file as **verified**; the titles say which class each really is.

| Category | Status | Item |
|---|---|---|
| core_gameplay | pass | Playtest bot: the core loop runs end to end on the production build (runtime-observed) |
| controls | pass | Playtest bot: steering by dragging the wheel and the winch timing reach their targets (runtime-observed) |
| technical | pass | Playtest bot: save → reload → load keeps the upgrade; no page errors (runtime-observed) |
| technical | pass | Playtest bot: deterministic and reproducible (same seed → identical run fingerprint) |
| presentation | pass | Playtest bot: the installed upgrade is visible on the boat and survives a reload (runtime-observed) |
| progression | pass | Simulation: every upgrade and vessel is reachable; the campaign completes (simulation-measured) |
| progression | pass | Simulation: upgrades measurably change play (sail speed, turning, range) |
| difficulty | pass | Balance is measured: headless simulations of economy, fuel, storms and voyages on the real game systems |
| difficulty | partial | Simulation: pacing between purchases (difficulty spikes) |
| difficulty | partial | Simulation: the Stormwall as the final barrier |
| difficulty | pass | Simulation: no economy exploits through crafting, fuel or repair |
| player_experience | pass | Playtest bot: time from casting off to the first upgrade (game time) |

## PLAYCRAFT before / after this evidence

Before: gitcraft-out/playcraft/verify (PLAYCRAFT pass on 546d5f3, no project evidence). After: playcraft_assess with docs/playcraft-evidence/playcraft-evidence.json + the same play report. Same game, same probe: only the evidence changed.

v = verified, o = observed, i = inferred (source only), n = not tested. Categories with only inferred evidence are capped at 70; that cap is what lifted for progression and difficulty. Game feel, replayability and mobile got no new evidence from this pack.

## Not covered: needs a human or an iPhone

- Frame rate, heat and battery on a real iPhone (headless software WebGL runs at 1-2 fps; all timing here is game time).
- Touch feel: the bot drags the wheel with pointer events in an iPhone-sized viewport, not with a finger on glass.
- Whether the winch is fun and fair for a person: the bot reads the needle position exactly; simulations fix winch results at 1, 2 or 3 of 3.
- Raider combat (the Captain’s Log goal "Drive off a Rustfang raider"): not simulated.
- Travel time between places in the economy simulations (sites are teleported to); beach finds and treasure digs are not used as income.
- The first-voyage tutorial (Turtle Atoll, anchor, dig) beyond the money loop; tests/e2e/play.cjs covers it with teleports.
- Audio, music, readability and whether it is fun: judgements a player has to record.
